Feature:  Manage details
As an Admin,
I want to manage the details of owners in the system,
So that I can keep up to date information about all owners.


Scenario: Add a new owner
  Given the correct web address
  When I navigate to the 'Owners' page
  And I click on the Add new tab
  And I fill in the details of the owner 
  And Add a new owner 
  Then I can see all the owners including the one I created

Feature:  Manage details
As an Admin,
I want to manage the details of owners in the system,
So that I can keep up to date information about all owners.


Scenario: Browse the owners available on the website
  Given the correct web address
  When I navigate to the 'Owners' page
  Then I can see all the owners of the pets at the clinic

Scenario: Adding an owner
  Given the correct web address
  When I navigate to the 'Owners' page
  Then I can add a new owner
